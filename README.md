# Modular Password Generator And Storage

## Version 1.0
 - Program used to generate random password which contain each lowercase and uppercase letter, numbers and some special characters.
 - Before it shows the usable password or stores it in that format to the database it first encrypts it using my own simple encrypt tool.
 - The user then has the ability to decrypt that password into a usable format 
 - In this current version the passwords are all saved in the text file passwords.txt that is located in the same folder as the python code is

## Version 1.1
- Added a bit more complex command syntax for a faster use, removed all the cases the program asked the user to input values.
- Cleaned up the code and removed unneccesarry and useless code
- Basic usage of the program can be accessed through "-help" or "-h" extensions
- This version still uses the passwords.txt file as a database to store the encrypted passwords
